# SimpleConsoleAdventure

Learning project for understanding interactions between different classes and properties.
Since it's relatively easy to dig into the logic of Unity 3D, e. g. to understand how to
create references to game objects, the same thing is not that easy, if there's no visual
interface. Everything has to happen in my brain and so I created some kind of adventure
with knights and dragons, to transfer my Unity progress to real understanding.
